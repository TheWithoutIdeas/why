# The Official WHY repository
Why discord bot (BETA, NOT FINISHED) If this github is public, that means the bot is finished and published to https://top.gg, https://discord.boats and some other sites. This bot will not be verified because it was just made as a testing, practicing and educational purposes only... nah just kidding i was just bored and wanted to make something cool with the least resources i could think of. If you want to make a bot INSPIRED by this one with the same resources i used and the ideias and want to verify it, there is no problem! Again, i will not verify this, this was just a fun-wise project that when i was bored decided to do because "why not" As for the final thing, please do not steal this project for complete and tell it's your own, as i said earlier, if you want to make a bot based on this one with the same ideias but not the same code and even want to verify it if it goes well, you are more then 100% welcome, but if you steal the entire code... that wouldn't be really cool!
Anyways, hope you like this ideia!
